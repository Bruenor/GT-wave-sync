# GT-wave-sync
This is an attempt to show the impact of syncing Golden Tower UW to the wave timer.
This theoretical calculation is done to illustrate the effects of golden tower cooldown, duration on coin income, using default wave timer (no wave accelerator card).
Maybe you aren't lucky to get black hole early, or don't want to get it, since it doesn't increase your survivability

# Prerequisites
Golden Tower Ultimate Weapon
Wave skip card (optional)
You are willing to press the upgrade cooldown button on your Golden Tower

# Predicted outcome
Due to the way Wave Skip works with Golden Tower, it is highly beneficial for Golden Tower to be active during the wave transition period, as it is at this time that you can skip a wave. Skipping a wave normally gives you a 1.10% bonus to coins. If Golden Tower is active during that time, that bonus gets multiplied by your GT multiplier. This is highly profitable, as you might have noticed.

# Observation
The data from this analysis suggests that the best GT cooldown to wave sync occurs at 280 seconds (8-1 natural sync).  
Next best sync time is at 210 seconds, but if you have this many stones, it is probably best used for acquiring black hole.
