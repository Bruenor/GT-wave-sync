# GT-wave-sync

This project explores the impact of syncing the **Golden Tower Ultimate Weapon (GT UW)** with the wave timer.  
Theoretical calculations are used to illustrate how **Golden Tower cooldown and duration** affect coin income, based on the **default wave timer** (without the Wave Accelerator card).  

The motivation:  
- You might not be lucky enough to get **Black Hole** early, or  
- You might prefer not to get it, since it does not increase survivability.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Golden Tower Ultimate Weapon  
- Wave Skip card (optional)  
- Willingness to press the **upgrade cooldown** button on your Golden Tower  

---

## 🎯 Predicted Outcome

Due to the way **Wave Skip** works with Golden Tower, it is highly beneficial for Golden Tower to be **active during the wave transition period**.  

- Normally, skipping a wave grants a **1.10% coin bonus**.  
- If Golden Tower is active during that time, the bonus is multiplied by your **GT multiplier**.  
- This is highly profitable - as I imagine you noticed.

## 🔍 Observation

- The analysis suggests the **best GT cooldown to wave sync** occurs at **280 seconds** (8-1 natural sync).  
- The next best sync time is **210 seconds** (6-1 natural sync). There is one in-between time of 245 seconds (7-1), but this needs a **legendary submodule effect**.
- However, if you have enough stones for 210s cooldown, they might be better invested in acquiring the **Black Hole** instead.

## 📌 Notes

This is a theoretical calculation meant to guide optimization strategies. Actual results may vary depending on your build and luck during a run.
